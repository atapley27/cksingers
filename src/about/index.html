      <h2>The Choir</h2>         
     <!-- <h3>Nancy Tapley</h3> -->
       <p> The CK Singers are a non-profit organization whose mandate is to serve Chatham-Kent. 
        Our group sings concerts  for Christmas- late November through early December as well as a spring line-up in late April and early May.
        We sing for free for nursing homes, having sung at St. Andrewâ€™s Residence, Hudson manor Tilbury, the Oaks Wallaceburg, Villa Angela and many others.
        These concerts are usually about 30-45 minutes and we do 3 or 4 each season.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Venue</h3>
          <p>First Presbyterian Church on Wellington St. In Chatham is currently allowing us to rehearse at no cost at their sanctuary and we are grateful for this.
             In return, we sing one major concert each season at this venue and the free will donations raised go to the charity of their choice.
              This concert is usually 60-90 minutes in length and also includes local soloists and instrumentalists and occasionally audience sing-a-longs.
