       It was formerly known as the Kent Glee Club and was established in the 1950’s under the direction of Sam Burton. 
       Our current director is Nancy Tapley and pianist is Joy Anderson.<br>             
       We meet from September - May on Tuesday nights from 7 -9pm at First Presbyterian Church (60 5th St, Chatham, ON). Come out and join us we are always looking for new members!<br>
       Choir members each pay $20 per season to cover the cost of insurance for our choir.
